# Eye-detection
The Blink Detection System is a Python application that uses computer vision to monitor eye blinks via webcam. It leverages OpenCV, Dlib, and SciPy to detect facial landmarks and calculate the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR). The system interprets blink patterns to provide text output for basic needs or emotions, aiming to assist in communication.
